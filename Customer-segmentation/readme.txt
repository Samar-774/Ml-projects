• Engineered an end-to-end customer segmentation solution using K-Means clustering 
  on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics for 500 e-commerce customers, 
  identifying 4 distinct behavioral segments and increasing targeted marketing 
  efficiency by enabling personalized retention strategies

• Conducted exploratory data analysis and applied StandardScaler preprocessing, then 
  utilized the Elbow Method to determine optimal cluster count (K=4), achieving 
  clear segment separation with actionable business profiles including Champions (31.6%), 
  At-Risk customers, and Hibernating users

• Created comprehensive 3D visualizations and pairplots to communicate segment 
  characteristics to stakeholders, delivering data-driven recommendations for each 
  segment (e.g., VIP rewards for Champions, win-back campaigns for At-Risk) that 
  directly informed marketing budget allocation and customer retention initiatives
