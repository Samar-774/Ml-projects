• Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict California housing prices 
  using Python and Scikit-learn, achieving an R² score of 0.813 and MAE of $39.92k through 
  Random Forest Regression on 20,000+ data points

• Performed comprehensive exploratory data analysis with correlation heatmaps and distribution 
  visualizations, identifying MedInc (median income) as the strongest predictor (r=0.872) 
  and engineered features using StandardScaler preprocessing

• Trained and optimized a 100-tree Random Forest model with feature importance analysis, 
  revealing that median income, geographic location, and house age account for 90.8% of 
  predictive power in housing valuation
